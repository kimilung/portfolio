		<p class="info">The challenge of this project was to redesign an opportunistic logo of our choice, for me it was Regal Entertainment Groups corporate company. The diamond shape represents REG's focus of bringing quality, size, and experience to movie go-ers experienceâ€”and being "best in class". The film strips running through the shape represents the company's dedication to history and craft.</p>
