		<p class="info">The assignment for this project was to create a promotional brochure for The Met. Covering the Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology exhibition, the design goal was to layout all the content and imagery in a way that reflects the unique style of fashion versus technology. Using typography, grid layout, and imagery I was able to achieve this through making appropriate design&nbsp;decisions.</p>
