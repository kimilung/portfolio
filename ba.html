		<p class="info">In this project, we were challenged to develop a logo for an international tourist city of choice. Diving into the creative process and exploring multiple ideas, the objective was to create a logo that represented the city appropriately.<br>Buenos Aires, Argentina&mdash;rich in history&mdash;combines the antiquity of the past with the modernization of today. A melting pot of european culture, the streets of Buenos Aires come to life with food, music, and dance. Capturing the essence and energy of the city was an important factor in this logo, as was to preserve the cultural history and art. The bandoneon&mdash;a musical instrument, much like an accordion&mdash;plays an essential role in the tango orchestra and is considered a symbol of tango itself. A beauty lies in its power as it provides a somber yet sensual sound, much like the history of Buenos Aires.</p>
